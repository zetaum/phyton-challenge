Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

This is the HW assignment for programming with Python. 
In this homework assignment I use the concepts I have learned in clas to complete the two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation.

Overview: python-challenge. 

The 2 challengers are as follows: PyBank and PyPoll and a file called main.py was created in each folder. In addition, "Resources" folders contain each CSV files for the analysis. 
The "analysis" folders contains the text file showing the results from each analysis.

PyBank - challenge
This challenge, contains the financial records of my company. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.


A Python script was created to analyze the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire periodThe average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
In addition, a final script contains both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.



PyPoll - challenge
This challenge, contains a set of poll date records of a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. The dataset, election_data.csv, is composed of two columns: oter ID, County, and Candidate.


A Python script was created to analyze the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.
In addition, a final script contains both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
